# SGDImputationPaper

Repository for the paper using sgdGMF for dimensionality reduction, 
batch effect removal and imputation of missing values for mass-spectrometry 
based proteomics data

## Setup and preprocessing of data

First, download the data from x, and put this file in the SGDImputationPaper 
folder. Then, one can download all the data and continue to preprocess these
based on the scripts under ‘Data/‘.
